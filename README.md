# FaceToHeart

Measure Heart Rate from Face.

## Inspired from

* [webcam-pulse-detector](https://github.com/thearn/webcam-pulse-detector)

Following documents and papers helped a lot in developing this.

* Measuring Heart Rate from Video - *Isabel Bush - Stanford* - [link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/prev_projects_2016/finalReport.pdf) 
* Real Time Heart Rate Monitoring From Facial RGB Color Video Using Webcam - *H. Rahman, M.U. Ahmed, S. Begum, P. Funk* - [link](http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/129/002/ecp16129002.pdf)
* Measuring Pulse Rate by using webcam - [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268685179_Measuring_the_pulse_rate_by_using_webcam)
